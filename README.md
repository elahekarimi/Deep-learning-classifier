Fashion MNIST Classification with TensorFlow/Keras
This repository contains a simple deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is designed to recognize 10 different categories of fashion items, including T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/fashion-mnist-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fashion-mnist-classification
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the code:

bash
Copy code
python fashion_mnist_classification.py
The script will load the Fashion MNIST dataset, create and train a neural network model, and make predictions on a sample of test images.

The results, including predicted labels, will be printed in the console.

Additionally, the script will display a sample image from the training set along with its true label.

Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of the following layers:

Flatten layer: Input layer to flatten the 28x28 images.
Dense layer with 300 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 200 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation (output layer).
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss. The training process includes 14 epochs, and the training/validation accuracy is monitored.

Data Augmentation
The script uses data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the diversity of the training dataset. This includes rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping.
